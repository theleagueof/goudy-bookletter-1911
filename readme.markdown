Goudy Bookletter 1911
========
_by [Barry Schwartz](http://crudfactory.com/font/show/gb1911)_

Based on Frederic Goudy’s Kennerley Oldstyle.

Notes from Barry:

> This font predates the League and is in the public domain.
>
> A few words on why I think Kennerley Oldstyle is beautiful: In making this font, I discovered that Kennerley fits together tightly and evenly with almost no kerning. Thus the following words from Monotype specimen books are just: “[W]hen composed into words the characters appear to lock into one another with a closeness common in early types, but not so often seen in later-day creations.” These are letters that take command of the space around them; notice, for instance, the bowed shapes of the v and w.
